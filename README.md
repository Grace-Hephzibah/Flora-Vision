# Flora-Vision
A sleek Streamlit app for flower enthusiasts. With a choice between a custom-trained model and a fine-tuned ResNet50, users can effortlessly classify flowersâ€”roses, daisies, dandelions, sunflowers, and tulips. Upload or pick random images to witness the magic of AI-driven classification.

# Objective
The primary objective of FloraVision was to create a solo-developed, user-friendly Streamlit web application 
that harnesses the power of machine learning for flower classification. With a focus on providing an interactive 
experience, the project aimed to empower users to effortlessly categorize various flowers, including roses, daisies, 
dandelions, sunflowers, and tulips, utilizing both a custom-trained model and a fine-tuned ResNet50 model. By offering
options to upload personal images or select randomly from a dataset, FloraVision sought to make flower identification 
engaging and accessible to all, highlighting the capabilities of AI in a visually appealing manner.
